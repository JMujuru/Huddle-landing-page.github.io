## My process

When starting this project I wanted to start it by doing a mobile-first approach I thought this would be an easier way to work on the project instead of doing web to mobile. 

I used nested layout techniques to get the structure of the HTML and CSS right learning this helped me know how to tackle new projects and how I would structure them while going through the project 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Getting more comfortable with CSS Flexbox as well as incorporating background images as I found getting close to the design was challenging. The other challenge I faced was that I had to make the social media icons change colour when hovering over I found this difficult to change the SVG colour but managed to do so. Also adjusting the screen size with media queries to make the site more responsive I adopted a mobile 1st approach in which I would make the site 1st through a mobile lens and then work outward to the size of a laptop or computer screen this helped me learn media queries better and adopt a better way of thinking when working on this project.


### Continued development 
I'm going to polish my skills with media queries so i can build more responsive/agile sites for user experience
